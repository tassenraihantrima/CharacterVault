## Data Persistence

CharacterVault currently uses browser LocalStorage.

This allows novels and character data to remain available after refreshing the browser without requiring a backend database.

Character portraits are converted into Base64 strings using the FileReader API and stored directly with each character.

## Motivation

When writing long novels, it becomes difficult to remember side characters, relationships, story events, and important details introduced many chapters earlier.

CharacterVault provides writers with a central workspace for organizing this information and maintaining story consistency throughout the writing process.
